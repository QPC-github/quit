QUIT(1): Cure your bad habit of mistyping
=========================================

QUIT is a forked and modified version of Masashi Toyoda's famous joke soft
'SL', aimed to correct you when you type 'sl' instead of 'ls' by mistake.
Quit prevents you from quitting command shell, while actually you intended to
'exit' from it.
